Data visualization of COVID-19 on Power BI allows users to gain valuable insights and understand the impact of the pandemic through interactive and visually appealing dashboards. By utilizing various visual elements such as charts, graphs, maps, and tables, Power BI enables users to explore and analyze COVID-19 data in a meaningful way.

The data visualization process begins by importing COVID-19 datasets into Power BI. These datasets typically contain information about confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and other relevant data points. Once the data is loaded, users can transform and shape the data to suit their specific needs.

One of the key benefits of Power BI is its ability to create dynamic and interactive visualizations. Users can leverage this feature to build intuitive dashboards that allow for easy exploration of COVID-19 data. I created line charts to track the daily progression of cases over time.

Power BI also provides the option to overlay COVID-19 data on maps, allowing users to visualize the spread of the virus across different countries, states, or cities. This feature can help identify hotspots and understand the geographical distribution of the pandemic.

I also inserted equations to calculate the recovery rate and fatality rate from the given information in the dataset. It gives a clear insight about the dataset and shows how good the recovery is.
